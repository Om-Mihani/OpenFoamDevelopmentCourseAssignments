# OpenFoamDevelopmentCourseAssignments

This repo is going to contain all my solutions to the assignment problems of the skill lync course Introduction to development in OpenFOAM. This is public, so all of you are welcome to suggest changes. Each assignment from week 5 onwards has a report and a code, both of which will be uploaded here. Kindly have a look.
